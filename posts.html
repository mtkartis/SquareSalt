		<div class="post-body">
			The above is a collection of ideas and images from the web that I thought would
			reflect my ideas about the development of Iron Sea. Most of these images are 
			old flash games that I used to play which have influenced my ideas for Iron 
			Sea. <br> <br>
			Although I have released a rough idea of what I imagine Iron Sea to be like,
			I have been thinking about the foundation of the game. Basically, the game consists
			of the player as a mech operator in a post-apocalyptic wasteland travelling as
			a merchant or a mercenary for hire. Quests and missions are given out to the player
			to make money and gain rewards. <br> <br>
			A few key ideas that still need to be solidified: <br>
			- monsters will be advancing toward the player. How will the player defend themself?
			As I want a management mechanic similar to Overcooked, I want the player to stop piloting
			the mech and deal with the oncoming enemeies separately from mech operation. Should I
			have a turret on the mech, or a personal weapon on the player? If a turret, would
			the player have to stop piloting the mech to operate, or would that be too much
			of a hassle? <br>
			- monsters can either drop materials or coins. Should I make the economy coin-based
			or should I make a bartering system like in Unexplored 2? <br>
			- should i have a claw attached to the underside of the mech, or would that be too 
			hard to code? Are there other feasable collection methods, or should the player
			automatically collect resources when enemies are killed? <br>
			- How should I move the mech? Since I am using inverse kinematics to move the legs, there 
			are a few options. I could bind each leg separately with opposing arrow keys. This would
			force the mech to move only forward. This is important to consider as I want 
			proximity-triggered	worm pits. Alternatively, I could simply move the furthest foot
			from the desired direction. This will allow more control over the mech's movemement.

		<div class="post-body">
			Something I've recently been thinking of is reusable elements 
			throughout my projects. An important element to have would be a UI
			menu that can scroll in perpendicular directions.
		</div>
		<div class="post-img"> 
			<img src="GridSelector.png" alt="Grid of Scrollable Elements" class="post-img"> 
		</div>
		<div class="post-body">
			I was thinking about making a grid with a central item that appears
			enlarged upon being focused on. The immediate items perpendicular to 
			the centre would be normal-sized and opaque. The diagonal corner elements
			would be half-alpha and normal-sized. <br> 
			When the user presses one of the
			arrow keys, the UI would scroll in that direction. Because I like precision,
			I would eliminate the option to scroll in a diagonal way. Scrolling would
			constitute each of the elements tweening to the adjacent space in the
			direction of the user-pressed arrow. If the element would become outside
			the grid, the element would fade to alpha 0, and delete. Elements coming into the
			grid would tween position and alpha to fade into their first slot. <br>
			An important idea to keep in mind, I found, is the mechanism by which the
			UI grid will trigger this mass movement of items. I would prefer a short
			and simple function that triggers the whole movement of the UI.
			As Godot has pre-made enumerations for Vector2 variables, I could use the
			direction enums (ie: Vector2.LEFT) as passed-in values. <br>
			<br>
			#This is the pseudocode layout <br>
			func input(): <br>
			&emsp; match arrow: <br>
			&emsp;&emsp;LEFT: <br>
			&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;GridElement.scroll(Vector2.LEFT) <br>
			#etc <br><br>
			This would allow for quick deploy of this custom element in my projects.
			The internal workings of the element seems a bit fuzzier than I would like,
			but eventually I will figure it out. I know I would also like the grid to
			resize itself depending on the size of the item sprites. Additionally, I would
			ideally want this grid feature to be optional, and have an export variable that
			decides if it is grid, grid without corners, horizontal only, or vertical only.
			I also have to keep in mind if there were missing elements within a grid, or rather,
			uneven columns to rows. <br>
			Regardless, this would mean I must have a non-changing variable that houses the
			contents of the items to be displayed in the grid UI. <br>
			I also need a way to track where I am within that non-changing content variable -- an
			index of sorts -- to denote what is to be displayed, and what is not. This is also
			important when deciding what items emerge when an arrow is pressed. <br>
			So far, I know I need: <br>
			1) A list of contents (decidedly within a 2D array representing the grid). <br>
			2) An index for those contents (Probably a Vector2 variable denoting the first
			and second indices of the nested arrays). <br>
			3) A single function that triggers the tweening of all the elements in the display. <br>
			<br>
			Alright. Another issue is easy integration of icon data. What format will this menu data take?
			What will be in the 2D array? I could represent icons directly, or perhaps some text. It is important
			to consider what the menu will visually represent. Will I have text labels, or will I have icons? Perhaps
			I will have both options... <br>
			If i were to have icons, I could uniformly fit their size to a constant size. Additionally, if I wanted to add
			text in the menu, I could use the icon method and paint the individual buttons that can be selected.
			For plain text, there is an advantage that I dont have to paint every button, but represent the menu
			content with simple strings, and then manipulate the theme in Godot for those strings. For flexibility,
			I will stick to icons instead of strings.<br>
			I have also noticed that the movement of the contents will be all uniform, making this task easier. I can separate
			a function out only tweening the position of each displayed item, and have another function that selectively tweens
			the elements' alpha and scale based on their prior position.

			Most of the site has been roughed out now.
			This site will be the home to my thoughts, ideas, and
			updates. Hopefully, someone will find SquareSalt as a
			useful resource to reflect on and derrive their own
			original thoughts from. There will be no rhyme or reason
			to the posts nor their schedule, but irregular updates
			may be saved here for later reflection.
